PROBLEM
Waste management is a big problem in our country. Most of the wastes end up in landfills. This leads to many issues like

Increase in landfills
Eutrophication
Consumption of toxic waste by animals
Leachate
Increase in toxins
Land, water and air pollution

APPROACH

Studied white papers on waste management
Analysed the components of household waste
Segregated into two classes (Organic and recyclable)
Automated the process by using IOT and machine learning
Reduce toxic waste ending in landfills

IMPLEMENTATION
Dataset is divided into train data (85%) and test data (15%)  

Training data - 22564 images  Test data - 2513 images

The dataset provided in this project is from SASHAANK SEKAR in Kaggle.
